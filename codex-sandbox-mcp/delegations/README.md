# Delegating Tasks from Claude Code to Codex (MCP Bridge)

This directory contains delegation patterns for offloading work from Claude Code to Codex via MCP.

## How It Works

Claude Code has Codex available as MCP tools: `mcp__codex__codex` and `mcp__codex__codex-reply`. When Claude calls these tools, they communicate with the Codex MCP server running inside a sandbox.

```
Claude Code (orchestrator)
    |
    | calls mcp__codex__codex with sandbox="workspace-write"
    v
Codex MCP Server (sandboxed via Bubblewrap/Seatbelt)
    |
    | executes in isolated namespace
    | can only write to cwd
    | no network access (strict mode)
    v
Returns results to Claude Code
```

## MCP Tools

### `mcp__codex__codex` — Start a new Codex session

| Parameter | Type | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `prompt` | string | **Yes** | The task description for Codex |
| `sandbox` | string | No | `"read-only"`, `"workspace-write"`, or `"danger-full-access"` |
| `approval-policy` | string | No | `"untrusted"`, `"on-failure"`, `"on-request"`, `"never"` |
| `cwd` | string | No | Working directory (the target repo) |
| `model` | string | No | Override model (e.g., `"gpt-5.2"`, `"gpt-5.2-codex"`) |
| `developer-instructions` | string | No | Extra instructions injected as developer role |
| `base-instructions` | string | No | Replace default instructions entirely |
| `profile` | string | No | Configuration profile from config.toml |

**Returns:** `{ threadId: string, content: string }`

### `mcp__codex__codex-reply` — Continue an existing conversation

| Parameter | Type | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `threadId` | string | **Yes** | Thread ID from previous codex call |
| `prompt` | string | **Yes** | Follow-up prompt |

**Returns:** `{ threadId: string, content: string }`

## Example Delegations

### Safe code editing (recommended default)

```
Tool: mcp__codex__codex
Parameters:
  prompt: "Add unit tests for the validateEmail function in src/utils/validation.ts.
           Use Jest. Run 'npm test' to verify all tests pass."
  sandbox: "workspace-write"
  approval-policy: "on-failure"
  cwd: "/Users/you/Git/my-project"
```

**What happens:**
- Codex reads the codebase, writes test files, runs `npm test`
- Can only write inside `/Users/you/Git/my-project`
- No network access (can't exfiltrate code)
- If a command fails, Codex asks for approval before retrying

### Read-only analysis

```
Tool: mcp__codex__codex
Parameters:
  prompt: "Review src/auth/ for security vulnerabilities. Check for:
           1. SQL injection
           2. Missing input validation
           3. Hardcoded secrets
           Report findings as a structured list."
  sandbox: "read-only"
  approval-policy: "never"
  cwd: "/Users/you/Git/my-project"
```

**What happens:**
- Codex reads code and produces a review
- Cannot modify any files
- No network access
- Fully autonomous (no approval needed — can't do anything dangerous)

### Task requiring network (use with caution)

```
Tool: mcp__codex__codex
Parameters:
  prompt: "Run 'npm install' to update dependencies, then run 'npm test'
           to verify nothing breaks. Report any test failures."
  sandbox: "danger-full-access"
  approval-policy: "untrusted"
  cwd: "/Users/you/Git/my-project"
```

**What happens:**
- No sandbox — full disk and network access
- But approval-policy is "untrusted" — Codex asks before running any non-trivial command
- Human must approve each potentially dangerous operation

## CLAUDE.md Instructions for Safe Delegation

Add these rules to your project's `CLAUDE.md` to ensure Claude always uses sandbox when delegating:

```markdown
## Codex Delegation Rules

When delegating tasks to Codex via mcp__codex__codex:

1. Always set sandbox: "workspace-write" unless the task requires otherwise
2. Use sandbox: "read-only" for analysis, review, and documentation tasks
3. Only use sandbox: "danger-full-access" when explicitly requested by the user,
   and always pair it with approval-policy: "untrusted"
4. Always set cwd to the specific project directory (never home dir or root)
5. Include clear acceptance criteria in the prompt
6. Include the specific test command to run
```

---

## The Orchestrator-Worker Loop

A typical Claude-Codex delegation cycle:

1. **Claude plans** — decomposes the task, identifies scope and constraints
2. **Claude delegates** — calls `mcp__codex__codex` with bounded prompt + sandbox
3. **Codex executes** — edits code, runs tests, reports results
4. **Claude reviews** — checks the output, decides if more work is needed
5. **Repeat or merge** — Claude delegates follow-up tasks or presents final result

### Example multi-step workflow

```
Claude: "I need to add email validation to the signup form."

Step 1 - Claude delegates analysis:
  mcp__codex__codex(sandbox="read-only", prompt="List all files related to
  the signup form. Show the current validation logic.")

Step 2 - Claude delegates implementation:
  mcp__codex__codex(sandbox="workspace-write", prompt="Add email validation
  to src/components/SignupForm.tsx using the existing validator pattern.
  Add tests. Run npm test.")

Step 3 - Claude reviews the diff and delegates polish:
  mcp__codex__codex(sandbox="workspace-write", prompt="The email validation
  works but is missing the error message display. Add an error message
  below the email field. Run npm test.")

Step 4 - Claude presents the final result to the user.
```

## Parallel Delegation (Fan-Out / Fan-In)

Claude Code can call multiple MCP tools in a single message. Each `mcp__codex__codex` call gets its own `threadId` and sandbox. Independent tasks run concurrently for significant speed gains.

**Prerequisite:** MCP tools must be pre-approved in `~/.claude/settings.local.json` for parallel calls to work seamlessly. When approval prompts are enabled, rejecting the first call in a batch cancels the entire batch. See the [Gemini SETUP guide](../gemini-web-mcp/SETUP.md#pre-approve-mcp-tools-for-parallel-delegation) for the permissions configuration.

```
Claude Code (orchestrator)
    |
    |--- mcp__codex__codex (read-only)  --> Security audit
    |--- mcp__codex__codex (read-only)  --> Performance review
    |--- mcp__gemini_web__web_search    --> Research best practices
    |
    v  (all return in parallel)
Claude Code synthesizes combined findings
```

### When to parallelize

| Scenario | Safe? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 3x `read-only` reviews on the same repo | Yes | Read-only cannot conflict |
| `workspace-write` tests for `src/auth/` + `workspace-write` tests for `src/billing/` | Yes | Different directories, no overlap |
| `read-only` review + `workspace-write` test gen for different modules | Yes | No file overlap |
| Web search + Codex analysis | Yes | Completely independent tools |
| `workspace-write` refactor + `workspace-write` test gen on same module | **No** | Overlapping files cause race conditions |
| Any task B that needs output of task A | **No** | Sequential dependency |

### Example: Multi-aspect code review (3 parallel Codex calls)

```
Claude receives: "Do a thorough review of src/auth/"

Claude emits three mcp__codex__codex calls in ONE message:

Call 1:
  prompt: "Security review of src/auth/. Check for injection, auth bypass,
           hardcoded secrets. Report structured findings."
  sandbox: "read-only"
  approval-policy: "never"
  cwd: "/Users/you/Git/my-project"

Call 2:
  prompt: "Performance review of src/auth/. Check for N+1 queries, missing
           indexes, unnecessary allocations. Report structured findings."
  sandbox: "read-only"
  approval-policy: "never"
  cwd: "/Users/you/Git/my-project"

Call 3:
  prompt: "Code quality review of src/auth/. Check for dead code, unclear
           naming, missing error handling. Report structured findings."
  sandbox: "read-only"
  approval-policy: "never"
  cwd: "/Users/you/Git/my-project"

All three run concurrently. Claude receives all results together,
synthesizes into a unified review, and presents to the user.
```

### Example: Research + review (web search + Codex in parallel)

```
Claude receives: "Research latest OWASP auth guidelines and review our auth code"

Claude emits two MCP calls in ONE message:

Call 1 (web search):
  mcp__gemini_web__web_search(query="OWASP authentication best practices 2026")

Call 2 (Codex):
  mcp__codex__codex(
    prompt: "Review src/auth/ for security vulnerabilities. Report findings.",
    sandbox: "read-only",
    cwd: "/Users/you/Git/my-project"
  )

Both run concurrently. Claude then compares Codex findings against
the latest OWASP guidelines from the web search.
```

### Follow-ups after parallel calls

After parallel initial calls return, use `mcp__codex__codex-reply` to continue specific threads:

```
Parallel fan-out returns threadId-A, threadId-B, threadId-C

Claude reviews results and decides threadId-A needs a fix:
  mcp__codex__codex-reply(
    threadId: "threadId-A",
    prompt: "Fix the SQL injection in src/auth/login.ts line 42."
  )
```

Follow-ups are sequential by nature since they depend on initial results.

## Enforced Delegations (Blocked Subagents)

These Claude Code subagents are blocked via PreToolUse hooks and must be delegated to Codex instead:

| Subagent | Why Blocked | Codex Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| `Explore` | Returns full findings to Claude's context | `read-only`, `never` |
| `test_gen` | Only creates skeletons with TODO assertions | `workspace-write`, `on-failure` |
| `doc_comments` | Only generates text, can't write files | `workspace-write`, `on-failure` |
| `diff_digest` | Summary consumes Claude's context | `read-only`, `never` |

**Token preservation:** These subagents process files within Claude's context window. By delegating to Codex, the file contents stay external — only the summary returns to Claude, saving 90-97% of tokens.

See [hooks/README.md](hooks/README.md) for hook configuration.
